## Description
A full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently save, organize, and manage their web links (bookmarks). Users can sign up, log in, add new links with details, and view their saved collection.

## Features
* User Authentication (Sign Up, Login)
* Add New Bookmarks (Title, URL, Description)
* View all saved bookmarks
* [Add any other specific features you implemented, e.g., Edit/Delete bookmarks, Search functionality, Categorization]

## Technologies Used
This project is built using the MERN stack:

**Frontend:**
* **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router DOM:** For client-side routing.
* **CSS:** For styling (potentially with a CSS preprocessor or framework if you used one).
* [Add any other frontend libraries/frameworks you used, e.g., Axios for API calls, Redux for state management, Material-UI/Bootstrap for components]

**Backend:**
* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side logic.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user data and bookmarks.
* **Mongoose:** An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
* **bcryptjs:** For password hashing.
* **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** For user authentication and authorization.
* [Add any other backend libraries/tools you used, e.g., CORS, dotenv]

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Nancy023/Link-Saver-App-.git](https://github.com/Nancy023/Link-Saver-App-.git)
cd Link-Saver-App

Backend Setup:
cd Backend
npm install
npm start # Or 'node server.js' if that's your main script

Frontend Setup:
cd ../frontend # To go back to root and then into frontend
npm install
npm start

Environment Variables (.env):
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

Adding a README.md file to your GitHub project is an excellent idea! It's the first thing people see when they visit your repository and acts as a quick guide to your project.

Here's a standard structure for a good README.md file, tailored for your "Link Saver App" (a full-stack project). You can copy this, paste it into a file named README.md in the root of your OMVAD Assignment folder, and fill in the details.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Nancy023/Link-Saver-App-.git](https://github.com/Nancy023/Link-Saver-App-.git)
cd Link-Saver-App
2. Backend Setup:
Navigate into the Backend directory, install dependencies, and start the server.

Bash

cd Backend
npm install
npm start # Or 'node server.js' if that's your main script
The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:5000 (or your configured port).

3. Frontend Setup:
Open a new terminal window, navigate into the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the client.

Bash

cd ../frontend # To go back to root and then into frontend
npm install
npm start
The frontend development server will typically run on http://localhost:3000.

4. Environment Variables (.env):
Create a .env file in your Backend directory and add your MongoDB connection URI and JWT secret:

MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
(If you used .env files in your frontend, also mention those instructions here.)

Usage
Once both the frontend and backend servers are running:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Sign Up: Register a new user account.
Login: Use your credentials to log in.
Add Links: Navigate to the dashboard or add link page to save new URLs.
View Links: See your saved links on the dashboard.
